I'm currently a 3rd year college student taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in Technological Institute of the Philippines - QC campus. I'm passionate about technology innovation and how technology works in different fields especially for the convenient use, I attended seminars and became a programming volunteer teacher in a learning center here in the Philippines, I also volunteered in a robotics outreach program to teach junior students about embedded systems and logic circuit design. I also enjoy software development, and UI/UX. ðŸ’»
